# Introduction
-	The precise determination of an object's trajectory is fundamental in various fields, including physics, engineering, and computer graphics. In this project, we delve into the realm of trajectory calculation, leveraging the power and efficiency of the C programming language to accurately predict the path of projectiles or entities in motion.

# Contribution 
**This section provides instructions and details on how to submit a contribution via a pull request. It is important to follow these guidelines to make sure your pull request is accepted.**
1. Before choosing to propose changes to this project, it is advisable to go through the readme.md file of the project to get the philosphy and the motive that went behind this project. The pull request should align with the philosphy and the motive of the original poster of this project.
2. To add your changes, make sure that the programming language in which you are proposing the changes should be same as the programming language that has been used in the project. The versions of the programming language and the libraries(if any) used should also match with the original code.
3. Write a documentation on the changes that you are proposing. The documentation should include the problems you have noticed in the code(if any), the changes you would like to propose, the reason for these changes, and sample test cases. Remember that the topics in the documentation is strictly not limited to the topics aforementioned, but are just an inclusion.
4. Submit a pull request via [Git etiquettes](https://gist.github.com/mikepea/863f63d6e37281e329f8)
